# Elephant Identification Research

This repository holds code used for research on identifying elephants from images.

Note that code was written haphazardly, so file names may not necessarily be logical.

The most important code files as of July 2nd are image_extractor.py, which was used to download images from the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust website, and model_comparison.py, which can be used to compare Roboflow YOLO object detection models using real elephant images.
